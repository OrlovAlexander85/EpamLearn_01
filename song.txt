On the eve of their doom
They are baptized
In the unholy waters of Bodom
With no hint of the torture awaiting
To greet them at the break of dawn

The Reaper
Is calling for you to come home
With the thrust of a switchblade
On the grip of a madman
And the waters of Bodom
Turn a blood shade of red
As the Children Of Bodom
Lake their last breath.
